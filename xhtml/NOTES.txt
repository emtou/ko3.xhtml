TODO:
-----
 - Cache files are not being cleared because the key is generated from the javascript - would generating from the uri be better?
 - Tested tiny_browser standalone with caching
     Failed because there is php in the file so relative paths are no good.
     Had to send the file into codes instead to get it working
 - Auto-set the correct config options for tidy 
    Had some trouble with this
	May move to a php only library (htmLawed: http://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed )
 - Style background images are often relative - parse and replace these with absolutes
